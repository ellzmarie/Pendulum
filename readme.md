# Pendulum ToDo List App

I decided to create a todo list app because I love using them! I've used plenty of different project management softwares like Asana, Notion, Click-up, Milanote, the notes app on my iphone and Jira. Since I enjoy using them, I thought it was be interesting to actually try to make my own. There are a ton of things that could be improved on my app but I have a greater appreciation for them now that I've tried to make my own and the simplest things took me forever to do. All in all, it was a fun rollercoaster.

I think this would be a fun personal project that I can continue iterating on. In the near future, I'd like to implement: 
- A calendar
- Automate tasks
- Basic authorization: restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource
- Consume a third-party API
- Send alerts when a task is due
- Create folders within a file so I can expand on a specific topic
- Schedule Tasks
- Collaborate with others
