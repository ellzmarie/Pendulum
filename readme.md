# Pendulum ToDo List App

I decided to create a todo list app because I love using them! I've used plenty of different project management softwares like Asana, Notion, Click-up, Milanote, the notes app on my iphone and Jira â€” softwares like these help me accomplish a lot of tasks, big and small . Since I enjoy using them, I thought it would be interesting to actually try to make my own. 

Since creating this app, I can definitely say that I have a greater appreciation for these project management/todo list tools now that I've tried to make my own. I underestimated the amount of time it would take and had a ton of ideas and features I wanted to add. But the simplest things took me forever to do. All in all, it was a fun rollercoaster.

I think this would be a fun personal project that I can continue iterating on. In the near future, I'd like to implement: 
- A calendar
- Automate tasks
- Basic authorization: restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource
- Send alerts when a task is due
- Create folders within a file so I can expand on a specific topic
- Schedule Tasks
- Collaborate with others
